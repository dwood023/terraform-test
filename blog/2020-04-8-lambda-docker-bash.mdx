As of [December 2020](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-for-aws-lambda-container-image-support/), AWS Lambda supports [packaging](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/gettingstarted-package.html) your function code and its runtime environment together, in the form of a Docker image.

## Why deploy Lambdas as images?

Packaging your lambda as a Docker image comes with some unique advantages:

### Benefit #1: Control over execution
Image deployments allow greater control over the environment in which your function code executes, as Docker images can specify an entire file structure.
This goes beyond what was previously possible using [layers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-layers.html) or a [custom runtime](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/runtimes-custom.html), as these options allowed only particular aspects of a Lambda's [execution environment](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/runtimes-context.html) to be customised.[^1]

### Benefit #2: Accessibility to developers
Docker makes some AWS-specific concepts redundant, such as layers.[^2]
This makes Lambdas simpler to think about and manage - everything is in the image!

Of course, for those already familiar and comfortable with layers and other AWS Lambda features, this may be less of a benefit.

:::question Why is "Benefit #3: locally replicable deployments" not on this list?
Good question - one of the general benefits of Docker is that it allows local development to occur in an identical environment to the one used in production.
However, this advantage does not apply exclusively to Docker-based Lambdas, due to the availability of [official preset images](https://hub.docker.com/r/lambci/lambda/) that can also be run locally.

## Example use case: Lambda using the AWS CLI

We wanted a Lambda to create IVS Channels, so we made an image from this Dockerfile:

```dockerfile
FROM amazon/aws-cli

RUN mkdir /var/task
WORKDIR /var/task
COPY bootstrap .
COPY create-channel.sh .

ENTRYPOINT ["./bootstrap"]
```

This doesn't do much - most of the power of Docker here comes from starting with a convenient base image.
Luckily, AWS provides a docker image with the AWS CLI pre-installed.
With this, all that was left to add to our image was our handler script (`create-channel.sh`) and our custom runtime (`bootstrap`).

:::question Is docker necessary for this case?
In retrospect, possibly not.
We found installing the AWS CLI in the preset environments difficult, so we switched to a custom image mostly just to debug this process.

### Uploading to ECR

To create a Lambda using a custom Docker image, the image must be hosted on ECR - AWS's docker repository service.

To do this, we can create a new ECR repository using the AWS CLI:

    aws ecr create-repository --repository-name example-repository
  
Which outputs:

    {
      "repository": {
          "repositoryArn": "arn:aws:ecr:eu-west-1:758924794885:repository/example-repository",
          "registryId": "758924794885",
          "repositoryName": "example-repository",
          "repositoryUri": "758924794885.dkr.ecr.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/example-repository",
          "createdAt": "2021-04-12T21:35:12+01:00",
          "imageTagMutability": "MUTABLE",
          "imageScanningConfiguration": {
              "scanOnPush": false
          },
          "encryptionConfiguration": {
              "encryptionType": "AES256"
          }
      }
    }

We can take the `repositoryUri` above, and upload to it. 
First, we need to build the image - tagging it with the repository URI.

    docker build . -t 758924794885.dkr.ecr.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/example-repository

Now, to upload the image we must authorise our Docker client to push to our ECR service (substitute your region below, and your account id instead of `758924794885`).

    aws ecr get-login-password --region eu-west-1 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin 758924794885.dkr.ecr.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com

If that succeeds, we can push our built image:

    docker push 758924794885.dkr.ecr.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/example-repository

Now, assuming we have a Lambda called `Example_Lambda` already (with the appropriate role permissions), we can convert it to use our image:
Now, we can create a lambda from our image:

    aws lambda create-function --function-name Example_Lambda --role arn:aws:iam::758924794885:role/example_role --package-type Image --code ImageUri=758924794885.dkr.ecr.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/example-repository:latest

:::question Huh? Where did that `arn:aws:iam::758924794885:role/example_role` role come from?
Ok, I got lazy and skipped documenting this step. ðŸ˜…
You will need to create a role with appropriate permissions (usually the fewest possible) for any Lambda you make.
:::

In future, we can update our Lambda to grab the latest pushed version of the image by running:

    aws lambda update-function-code --function-name Example_Lambda --image-uri 758924794885.dkr.ecr.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/example_repository:latest



[^1]: Specifically layers only allow files to written to a [handful of paths](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-layers.html#configuration-layers-path) on a preset environment, and custom runtimes only allow changes to one file - the Lambda's "bootstrap" script.

[^2]: Since code re-use and composition are possible in Docker by using [base images](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#from) and [multi-stage builds](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build/), respectively.
