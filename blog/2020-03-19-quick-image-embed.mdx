Here's a quick tip for embedding images in markdown documents (like this one), using dropbox!

:::note
For this, you will need the Dropbox desktop client installed:

    brew install dropbox
:::

Then, once Dropbox is opened (and you are logged in), open the preferences window...

...and switch on "Share screenshots and screen recordings using Dropbox".

Now, whenever you take a screenshot[^1] , Dropbox will not only host it for you, but will copy a link to the hosted image straight to your clipboard!

Now you can simply paste directly into your markdown, as an image source:

```md
![](https://www.dropbox.com/s/tvfan3qcxtazgox/Screenshot%202021-03-19%20at%2009.59.41.png?dl=0)
```

...BUT make sure to change the `0` in `dl=0` (at the end) to `1`:

```md
![](https://www.dropbox.com/s/tvfan3qcxtazgox/Screenshot%202021-03-19%20at%2009.59.41.png?dl=1)
```

There! Now you have permanent links to your screenshots in a highly convenient two-step process!
