import Link from "@docusaurus/Link"

Metro is a Javascript bundler that was included with the React Native template we started with in a <Link to="/blog/trying-react-native-1">previous post</Link>.

Metro is referred to as being specifically "for" React Native:

But what does this actually mean?
How is Metro different to the myriad other JS bundlers?

:::question How is Metro "for" React Native?
Based on [this issue](https://github.com/facebook/metro/issues/403) on Metro's Github page, it sounds like this is only half-true to begin with.
The "React Native" configuration of Metro is not actually inherent to Metro, but is instead provided by the React Native CLI (see [here](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli/blob/760708fc3216aee565f59877a103a7e35df2d77d/packages/cli/src/tools/loadMetroConfig.ts)).

:::question Why was Metro created?
According to [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactnative/comments/fk6h98/why_was_it_necessary_to_create_the_metro_bundler/) on Reddit, the reason may be more historical/cultural than technical.
When RN was first developed, Facebook wrote their own bundler for it (for whatever reason) and it's just never gone away - despite Webpack and others emerging as more flexible alternatives.[^1]

## Inspecting Metro's output

Let's bundle our template using the React Native CLI...

    npx react-native bundle  --entry-file index.js --bundle-output bundle.js

...and see what a sample of the output looks like:

    $ head bundle.js
    var __BUNDLE_START_TIME__=this.nativePerformanceNow?nativePerformanceNow():Date.now(),__DEV__=true,process=this.process||{},__METRO_GLOBAL_PREFIX__='';process.env=process.env||{};process.env.NODE_ENV=process.env.NODE_ENV||"development";
    (function (global) {
    "use strict";

    global.__r = metroRequire;
    global[__METRO_GLOBAL_PREFIX__ + "__d"] = define;
    global.__c = clear;
    global.__registerSegment = registerSegment;
    var modules = clear();
    var EMPTY = {};

Oh yeah, it's not going to be very readable.

## Comparing to Parcel's output

I guess we could at least compare the output to Parcel's for the same project...

```
$ npx parcel build index.js

  ðŸš¨  /Users/dav/Codices/Moar/Prototypes/ReactNativeDemo/node_modules/react-native/index.js:14:7: Unexpected token, expected "{" (14:7)
  12 |
  13 | // Components
> 14 | import typeof AccessibilityInfo from './Libraries/Components/AccessibilityInfo/AccessibilityInfo';
    |       ^
  15 | import typeof ActivityIndicator from './Libraries/Components/ActivityIndicator/ActivityIndicator';
  16 | import typeof Button from './Libraries/Components/Button';
```

Uhh... Ok.
Bad luck for us, Parcel is having trouble with these Flow-related import statements.

Actually, Parcel avoids applying transforms (e.g. for Flow annotations) to third-party modules _by-design_.[^2]
It does this under the assumption that node modules are typically shipped with all non-standard features removed (i.e. already transformed into standard JS).
This sounds reasonable, but for our `react-native` dependency, it's violated!

How can this be?!
Why does React Native ship with this Flow stuff left in?
Am I missing something here?

:::question Why does React Native ship with Flow annotations left in the source code?

According to [this discussion](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/10966), leaving those Flow annotations in the published NPM package *is* non-standard practice, but the React Native project does it anyway. ðŸ˜’

:::
:::question Ok, so how does Metro or the React Native CLI remove them?

I'm not sure... 
I suppose Metro might be designed to expect this unusual situation - when we run it via the React Native CLI (using the `bundle` or `start` command) perhaps it knows to transpile some of its dependency modules too?

As for how it does this - the babel config it uses to do so is [ this one ](https://github.com/facebook/metro/blob/master/packages/metro-react-native-babel-preset/src/configs/main.js#L172), which does indeed have a plugin for stripping Flow types (as we saw was necessary in our original Parcel error).
However, this config does not seem to specify that it should apply to `node_modules`...

Hmm....
:::

Unfortunately, at the time of writing I have been unable to answer this final question, so my progress (on figuring out why Metro is used) has halted.

At this point, all I can say is that the React Native project appears to have been designed specifically for use with Metro as a bundler, and unless a full account of how the two projects are coupled is made, it is unknown how or how difficult it would be to use an alternative bundler.
