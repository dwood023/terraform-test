IVS is a AWS service that provides a fully managed cloud infrastructure for streaming video.
This includes various components: 

- An ingest server (receives [RTMP](https://wwwimages2.adobe.com/content/dam/acom/en/devnet/rtmp/pdf/rtmp_specification_1.0.pdf) connections e.g. from some broadcasting software such as OBS)
- A transcoder (converts the payload of ingested RTMP packets into the format in which they will be consumed e.g. HLS)
