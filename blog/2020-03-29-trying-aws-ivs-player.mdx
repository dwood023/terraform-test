IVS is a AWS service that provides a fully managed cloud infrastructure for streaming video.
This includes various components: 

- An ingest server (receives [RTMP](https://wwwimages2.adobe.com/content/dam/acom/en/devnet/rtmp/pdf/rtmp_specification_1.0.pdf) connections e.g. from some broadcasting software such as OBS)
- A transcoder (converts the payload of ingested RTMP packets into the format in which they will be consumed e.g. HLS)
- A CDN (distributes the  media to users around the world)

##

## Trying out the player

For the following steps, we will basically follow [this AWS doc: "SDK for web guide"](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ivs/latest/userguide/player-web.html).

### Including the IVS Player SDK

Starting with a basic web app project, we'll include the IVS Player script somewhere in our app or HTML document:

```html
<script src="https://player.live-video.net/1.2.0/amazon-ivs-player.min.js"></script>
```

:::question Why not install the player locally as an NPM module?
We could do (see "Setup With NPM" in ), but there are some fiddly set up steps with that approach (to do with [ linking the player's wasm worker and binary ](https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-ivs-player-web-sample/blob/master/samples/npm-sdk/npm-sdk.ts#L20)).
These are not prohibitive, but it's simpler to proceed with the external script for this basic demo.
:::

Now before we try to use the player, we can check the script loaded successfully by logging a new global `IVSPlayer` variable (which the script should have defined for us):

```ts
// should log "true" for the following steps to work
console.log(IVSPlayer.isPlayerSupported)
```

Assuming that logged `true`, we can proceed to load a stream:

```ts
const player = IVSPlayer.create()
player.load(PLAYBACK_URL)
player.play()
```

But wait, what's `PLAYBACK_URL`?
We haven't defined anything like that yet! ðŸ˜¦

It seems we've reached the limit of what we can implement without setting up any infrastructure.

To find out what a playback URL is (as well as how to get one) we need to turn our sights to the backend for a while.
In doing this, we need to look at a new IVS concept - channels.

## Creating a channel

In IVS, a playback URL is a property of a **channel**, so we will need to create one for our demo.

:::question In the context of IVS, what's a "channel"?
IVS provisions streaming infrastructure on the basis of units it calls **channels**.
Each channel has a stream key and endpoint for ingesting data (from the streamer) and another for playback (by the viewer).

In effect, a channel represents a unique source of streamed video, such as a single broadcaster (or broadcasting group) that viewers can tune into.
:::

Various methods are available for doing this, and since we are getting familiar with IVS we will take the time to try a few.

### Method 1: Management Console

There.
Click that big orange button.

Skipping over the config step, we get our playback URL:

![](https://www.dropbox.com/s/k10y2ysjs15lbys/Screenshot%202021-03-31%20at%2009.01.49.png?dl=1)

This method is for cowards.
Besides, we are too l33t for that, so let's keep going.

### Method 2: AWS CLI

The [ `ivs` subcommand ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ivs/index.html#cli-aws-ivs) of the AWS CLI allows the creation of new channels with the following syntax (documented [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ivs/index.html#cli-aws-ivs)):

```bash
aws ivs create-channel
  [--name <value>]
  [--latency-mode <value>]
  [--type <value>]
  [--authorized | --no-authorized]
  [--tags <value>]
  [--cli-input-json <value>]
  [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]
```
For a full description of these options, see  .

:::note
As always, you will need to [ configure your AWS CLI ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html) to use your preferred credentials.

To do this, either pass an existing profile using the `--profile` option or add a default for all subsequent commands by running `aws configure`.
:::

You can even run it without options (in which case defaults are used):

    aws ivs create-channel

This produces the following output, describing your new channel:

```json
{
    "channel": {
        "arn": "arn:aws:ivs:eu-west-1:758924794885:channel/cAJKJJmhBzlC",
        "name": "",
        "latencyMode": "LOW",
        "type": "STANDARD",
        "ingestEndpoint": "24e48b867b6f.global-contribute.live-video.net",
        "playbackUrl": "https://24e48b867b6f.eu-west-1.playback.live-video.net/api/video/v1/eu-west-1.758924794885.channel.cAJKJJmhBzlC.m3u8",
        "authorized": false,
        "tags": {}
    },
    "streamKey": {
        "arn": "arn:aws:ivs:eu-west-1:758924794885:stream-key/njDi22M1LbAQ",
        "value": "sk_eu-west-1_njDi22M1LbAQ_VQBkbdOI8nK7w9r3yzJHGkHHRsUsNM",
        "channelArn": "arn:aws:ivs:eu-west-1:758924794885:channel/cAJKJJmhBzlC",
        "tags": {}
    }
}
```

Among other details listed, there is our Playback URL (`playbackUrl`).

```json
"playbackUrl": "https://24e48b867b6f.eu-west-1.playback.live-video.net/api/video/v1/eu-west-1.758924794885.channel.cAJKJJmhBzlC.m3u8",
```

### Method 3: CloudFormation

[Cloudformation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/) is an "Infrastructure-as-Code" system, similar to [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) but developed exlusively for (and by) AWS. 

Instead of using the AWS CLI or management console to configure our infrastructure, CloudFormation allows us to specify a ["stack"](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/stacks.html) of services via a plaintext ["template"](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/template-guide.html) file (either [JSON or YAML](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/template-anatomy.html)) that can be checked into source control and used to automatically provision the specified services.

The structure of a Cloudformation template consists (mainly) of a few basic elements:

1. [ Resources ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/resources-section-structure.html) (representing services to provision)
2. [ Parameters ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/parameters-section-structure.html) (that enable resources to be configured at runtime)
3. [ Rules ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/rules-section-structure.html) (that enable validation of parameters)

More advanced features are available, but these are largely for composing and parameterising templates further, see [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/template-anatomy.html) for details.

For now, we will stick to the basics: how can we specify a resource that provisions an IVS channel?

Within the [full list of services covered by Cloudformation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-template-resource-type-ref.html), the types pertaining to IVS are listed [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/AWS_IVS.html).
In total, there are only 3:

- AWS::IVS::Channel
- AWS::IVS::PlaybackKeyPair
- AWS::IVS::StreamKey

Although we will probably need to create a stream key too, let's focus just on the channel.
A minimal CloudFormation template (YAML) for this would resemble the following:

```yaml
AWSTemplateFormatVersion: "2010-09-09"

Description: This stack is just for testing IVS!

Resources:
  TestChannel: 
    Type: AWS::IVS::Channel
    Properties:
      Name: "TestChannel"
```
Now we can deploy a new stack based on this template using the AWS CLI:

    aws cloudformation deploy --template-file ivs.yaml --stack-name "TestStack"

Which outputs:

    Waiting for changeset to be created..
    Waiting for stack create/update to complete
    Successfully created/updated stack - TestStack

That sounded hopeful, but let's confirm what that `deploy` command did.

First, did it really create a stack in CloudFormation?
We can find out with the CLI:

    aws cloudformation list-stacks

Which outputs:

```json
{
    "StackSummaries": [
      {
          "StackId": "arn:aws:cloudformation:eu-west-1:758924794885:stack/deleteme/09f39b10-92c3-11eb-8a0a-06cc4292e70d",
          "StackName": "TestStack",
          "TemplateDescription": "This stack is just for testing IVS!",
          "CreationTime": "2021-04-01T08:19:54.929000+00:00",
          "LastUpdatedTime": "2021-04-01T08:20:00.250000+00:00",
          "StackStatus": "CREATE_COMPLETE",
          "DriftInformation": {
              "StackDriftStatus": "NOT_CHECKED"
          }
      },
    ]
}
```

Cool, so CloudFormation did indeed create a stack - corresponding in some way to the template we deployed.

Does it have our channel resource though?
Let's check:

    aws cloudformation list-stack-resources --stack-name TestStack

```json
{
    "StackResourceSummaries": [
        {
            "LogicalResourceId": "TestChannel",
            "PhysicalResourceId": "arn:aws:ivs:eu-west-1:758924794885:channel/ppBHd9pTqrh5",
            "ResourceType": "AWS::IVS::Channel",
            "LastUpdatedTimestamp": "2021-04-01T08:20:10.276000+00:00",
            "ResourceStatus": "CREATE_COMPLETE",
            "DriftInformation": {
                "StackResourceDriftStatus": "NOT_CHECKED"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

Good!
So CloudFormation created a stack called `TestStack` **and** created its resources (a single IVS channel, in this case).

Finally, let's check the creation of this IVS channel is represented by IVS itself.
Conveniently, the `list-stack-resources` command we ran above gave us the ARN of our alleged channel (under the field `PhysicalResourceId`), so we can ask IVS about it directly:

    aws ivs get-channel --arn arn:aws:ivs:eu-west-1:758924794885:channel/ppBHd9pTqrh5

```json
{
    "channel": {
        "arn": "arn:aws:ivs:eu-west-1:758924794885:channel/ppBHd9pTqrh5",
        "name": "TestChannel",
        "latencyMode": "LOW",
        "type": "BASIC",
        "ingestEndpoint": "24e48b867b6f.global-contribute.live-video.net",
        "playbackUrl": "https://24e48b867b6f.eu-west-1.playback.live-video.net/api/video/v1/eu-west-1.758924794885.channel.ppBHd9pTqrh5.m3u8",
        "authorized": false,
        "tags": {}
    }
}
```

Fantastic - everything we asked for was created, and all the relevant services say so!
Not only that, the above command gave us our Playback URL - victory!
