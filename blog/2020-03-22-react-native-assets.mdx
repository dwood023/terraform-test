For a web developer, adding fonts to a React Native project can be a puzzling task.
We'd usually reach for CSS rules like `@font-face` and `@import`, but with React Native these are off the table.
To make matters worse, we have multiple target platforms to consider - so won't there be different steps for each? ðŸ˜¨

The answer is yes, but the React Native CLI can help with this.
All we need is to:

1. Configure the React Native CLI with an `assets` directory, and
2. Run `react-native link` whenever 

## 1. Configure the CLI with an `assets` directory

The React Native CLI can be configured by adding a `react-native.config.js` file to your root directory.[^1]
To add fonts to our project, we need to add an `assets` entry to its exports:

```js
module.exports = {
	assets: [
		"./assets" // NOTE: Use whatever directory you like
	],
}
```

Now we can add fonts to the directory specified above.
For example, I might add some fonts to mine like so:

Now, how do we make these fonts available on our target platforms?

## 2. Run `react-native link`

Besides installing native dependencies, the React Native CLI's `link` command can also "link" the contents of our newly configured asset directory, to each of our native target platforms.[^2]
Simply run:

	yarn react-native link

Which outputs:

	node_modules/.bin/react-native link
	info Linking assets to ios project
	warn Group 'Resources' does not exist in your Xcode project. We have created it automatically for you.
	info Linking assets to android project
	success Assets have been successfully linked to your project
	âœ¨  Done in 0.69s.

Success!
Or at least, according to the CLI...

## Using our fonts 

Lets test by using our custom font in a component:

:::note
I am using styled-components here, but a similar syntax should work with inline styles.
:::

```js
const CustomFontText = styled.Text`
  font-family: "Lato";
`
```

Now when we use this component in a simulator, it should have our custom font applied!
Viola!

## (Optional) Inspecting the changes

Now we know our fonts are working, let's take a look at _how_ they're working.
What did that `react-native link` command do?

	git status --short

Which outputs:

	M ios/ReactNativeDemo.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj
	M ios/ReactNativeDemo/Info.plist
	?? android/app/src/main/assets/
	?? assets/

Interesting...
As expected, it updated both our Android and iOS projects in some way.
Let's investigate further:

### Changes to iOS project

#### Changed file #1. Info.plist

Let's take a look:
 
	git diff ios/ReactNativeDemo/Info.plist
 
```xml
        <key>UIViewControllerBasedStatusBarAppearance</key>
        <false/>
+       <key>UIAppFonts</key>
+       <array>
+               <string>Lato-Black.ttf</string>
+               <string>Lato-BlackItalic.ttf</string>
+               <string>Lato-Bold.ttf</string>
+               <string>Lato-BoldItalic.ttf</string>
+               <string>Lato-Italic.ttf</string>
+               <string>Lato-Light.ttf</string>
+               <string>Lato-LightItalic.ttf</string>
+               <string>Lato-Regular.ttf</string>
+               <string>Lato-Thin.ttf</string>
+               <string>Lato-ThinItalic.ttf</string>
+       </array>
 </dict>
 </plist>
```

Ok, that makes sense.
Info.plist is some kind of metadata for the project, with a property `UIAppFonts` which now lists my new fonts!

#### Changed file #2. project.pbxproj

This file had a large number of changes, so I'll skip over most of them.
To give some idea of the changes, here's one addition that may be relatively meaningful:

	git diff ios/ReactNativeDemo.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj

Perhaps the easiest part to make sense of are entries added to a section called `PBXFileReference`.
Here is an example:

	+               C8E4E1C65AAD4C5297C9E07F /* Lato-Black.ttf */ = {isa = PBXFileReference; name = "Lato-Black.ttf"; path = "../assets/L
	ato/Lato-Black.ttf"; sourceTree = "<group>"; fileEncoding = undefined; lastKnownFileType = unknown; explicitFileType = undefined; inc
	ludeInIndex = 0; };

This corresponds to one of our newly added font files!
Notably, this entry even references the path of our top-level `assets` folder - so for iOS at least, there is no redundant copying of assets!

### Changes to Android project

For Android, it seems the only changes made by linking assets is the copying of our whole assets folder to `android/app/src/main`.

	tree android/app/src/main/assets/

```
	android/app/src/main/assets/
	â””â”€â”€ fonts
			â”œâ”€â”€ Lato-Black.ttf
			â”œâ”€â”€ Lato-BlackItalic.ttf
			â”œâ”€â”€ Lato-Bold.ttf
			â”œâ”€â”€ Lato-BoldItalic.ttf
			â”œâ”€â”€ Lato-Italic.ttf
			â”œâ”€â”€ Lato-Light.ttf
			â”œâ”€â”€ Lato-LightItalic.ttf
			â”œâ”€â”€ Lato-Regular.ttf
			â”œâ”€â”€ Lato-Thin.ttf
			â””â”€â”€ Lato-ThinItalic.ttf
```

Presumably, Android projects require none of the configuration that iOS projects do for adding static assets.
Instead, they seem to simply expect that these assets will always be under this predictable, standard path.
Neat!

## Lessons learned

Clearly, Android and iOS projects refer to assets differently:
Android requires assets to be copied to a standard location, whereas iOS projects can reference assets from anywhere.

This is just one of the ways cross-platform native development can be confusing - we'll look out for others in future articles.
