import Link from "@docusaurus/Link"

To use SVGs in my project, I want to install a library called [`react-native-svg`](https://github.com/react-native-svg/react-native-svg).

But with React Native, how will this be possible?
Won't there be complications if the libraries include native code?

Well, yes - but <Link to="/blog/react-native-assets">as we found with the challenge of linking assets</Link>, the React Native CLI has tools to help us.
In fact, recent releases of the CLI do a lot of this work completely automatically (through a process they call [autolinking](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli/blob/master/docs/autolinking.md#autolinking).

All we need to do is install the package in question:

	yarn add react-native-svg

And then one more step (just for iOS):
	
	cd ios && pod install && cd ..

And that's it!

Why did we have to do that?
I don't know!

Why didn't we need to do anything from Android?
No idea!
