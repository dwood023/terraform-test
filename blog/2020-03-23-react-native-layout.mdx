Instead of CSS, React Native uses a layout engine called [Yoga](https://yogalayout.com) for styling and positioning UI elements.
Although it resembles CSS, don't be fooled - nearly all of its features and syntax work at least slightly differently!

:::question Why do we have another layout engine? Learning CSS was hard enough!

Although CSS is a well-known standard that most developers are already familiar with, it was designed to target one platform only - the web.

With React Native, our layouts need to translate to different platforms, which each have a layout engine of their own.
We therefore need our layout engine to be highly general and translate easily to others.

It's in this respect that CSS (which is highly elaborate and specialised) is not well suited, compared to a simpler one like Yoga.
:::

Don't feel too bad, though, as Yoga is in many ways much simpler than CSS.
For one, it has fewer properties (~50, vs CSS's ~150), and encourages a much simpler approach to layouts.

In this article, we'll cover some of the unintuitive differences I found between CSS and Yoga.

## Flexbox

Although this is not explicitly documented anywhere, I have discovered(?) that Yoga makes all 


The value `1` can be any integer (`0`, `1`, `2`, `3`), but be careful what these mean:

## Mystical `align-self` hack

This tip makes no sense.

It uses the `align-self` property, which is [ _supposed_ ](https://yogalayout.com/docs/align-items) to basically override the `align-items` setting of an element's flex-container, like this:

```jsx
 // "All children, go to the center of the cross Axis!" - Flex Container
<View style={{flex: 1, alignItems: "center"}}>

  {/* "Yes, sir!" - Flex item */}
  <View>Obedient Flex item</View>

  {/* "No, I don't think I will" - Flex item */}
  <View style={{alignSelf: "flex-start"}}>Rebellious Flex item</View>
</View>
```

However, I saw another strange use for this property in [ a StackOverflow post ](https://stackoverflow.com/a/65332769).
Take this snippet as an example:

```jsx
  <View> {/* <-- NOT a flex container by default (or is it?) */}
    <View style={{backgroundColor: "pink"}}> 
      <Text>Hey!</Text>
    </View>
  </View>
```

This renders to something like this (on iOS):

```jsx
  <View> {/* <-- NOT a flex container by default (or is it?) */}
    <View style={{backgroundColor: "pink", alignSelf: "center"}}> 
      <Text>Hey!</Text>
    </View>
  </View>
```

## Styled Components

Styled components supports React Native primitives with the same API as it uses for regular DOM elements.
For example:

```js
const H2 = styled.Text`
  font-size: 18px;
  font-weight: 800;
  font-family: "Open Sans";

  margin-bottom: 20px;
  flex: 2;
`
```

This makes using Yoga even closer to regular CSS syntax.
But watch out - there are some confusing caveats.

### Units

React Native uses unitless measurements, so you can normally omit units like this:

```jsx
<View style={{width: 250}}>
```

Due to the (lazy) implementation of the styled-components library
